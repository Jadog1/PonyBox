For Twillight Sparkle and Samuel! This is the main storyline to follow!

~~Twilight && Samuel

A cardboard box is all that you have when you move into Ponyville. A cardboard box that held a small pendant that took the same colour and shape of the your cutie mark.

This pendant is the last thing that you were left before your parents left in search for the "Crystal Soulkeeper;' an artifact that is said to have the power to trap ponies' souls inside of it. You see, your parents were adventurers and tomb-raiders, just like the great Daring Duo. You yourself found what they did quite interesting, but you didn't seem to have the skills or requirements for it. Eventually, you and they gave up, dubbing you a "non-adventurer." In fact, you eventually became very skillful in the practice of combat, and were eventually doing it almost like a pro. You still like to practice, but you were always determined on getting your own cutie mark.

And today, you finally got one. A cutie mark, that is. Two years since your parents left. Technically, you were old enough to live on your own, and therefor didn't end up breaking any laws. Excited for the cutie mark, you decided to venture off down your own path in life, and move into Ponyville.

Simply put, your cutie mark was the symbol of a flame in front of a heart. You yourself firmly believed that it meant that you had "an everlasting flame burning inside of you," and you liked to stick to that theory. You actually got your cutie mark pretty late. Most other ponies got their cutie marks before they got out of school, but you only just got yours a couple of years after graduating. Of course, ponies would tease you about it, but you quickly learned to keep to yourself and not care about what they say.

You don't really have any friends to talk to, so you planned on going to check if there was a pet store in Ponyville when you got there. Speaking of friends, you are actually very socially unstable, and don't really speak to many ponies other than business ponies or shop clerks.

(Okay... Imma stop talking 2nd person)

The player will go to Ponyville, eventually meet the mane six (and some others), and tell the six his/her story. Once told, the six would want to help the player find the artifact that their parents looked for. Of course, this only happens in late game. Early game would only include the meeting of the player and the mane six, and other calamities including ursur minors, ursur majors, packs of timberwolves, Chrysalis and her minions, Sombra, an insecure Discord (he doesn't like how you hang around with Fluttershy) and a pre-meeting(before the bigger boss battle/end game) with a new, game-exclusive villain called the Glitchmaster. He is a pony who has a sort of binary magic and a mean attitude. He wants to take over Equestria, starting with Ponyville.

Upon winning the final boss battle, you gain hold of the artifact, and find out that your parents are locked away in it and save them!

A sequel may be possible if this gets any bigger than I imagine, or if in high demand.
